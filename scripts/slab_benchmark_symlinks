# This is a script that runs multiple vasp jobs to optimize a structure and then perform analyses

# There are a few stages
# 1. Optimize the structure on low setting (INCAR_LOW) 
#	- EDIFF = 1.0E-4
#	- EDIFFG = -0.05
#	- Prec = Accurate
# 2. Optimize the structure on medium setting (INCAR_MED)
#	- EDIFF = 5.0E-4 
#	- EDIFFG = -0.05
#	- Prec = Accurate
# 3. Optimize the structure on high setting (INCAR_HIGH)
#	- EDIFF = 1.0E-5
#	- EDIFFG = -0.01
#	- Prec = Accurate


# The script will also perform a few analyses
# 1. Band structure
# 2. DOS
# 3. Band structure with spin orbit coupling
# 4. DOS with spin orbit coupling

# These analyses will be performed using the following INCAR settings
# EDIFF = 1.0E-6
# EDIFFG = -0.01
# Prec = Accurate

#Each step will be performed in a separate directory
# 1. Low_opt
# 2. Med_opt
# 3. High_opt
# 4. Band
# 5. DOS
# 6. Band_soc
# 7. DOS_soc
